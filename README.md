# Project Abstract
MedAssist is an assistive mental health platform powered by a large language
model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It offers a free,
accessible, and unbiased alternative to mental health care. The system connects
an LLM to trusted DSM-5 knowledge to give accurate, context-aware responses.
Through an interactive chat interface, users are able to express their thoughts,
monitor mood patterns, and track personal growth over time. Alternative
resources are also provided for users requiring more professional medically-
focused assistance.
