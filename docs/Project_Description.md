## General Description
This project serves as a way to display our technical accumen, explore the expanding field of artificial intelligence, give back to the community in a meaningful way, and combat a problem everyone can relate with. Mental health care is not always readily available and those suffering may be hesistant to reach out. We seek to provide a free, private alternate that not only provides information on how users can improve but allows them to directly interact and confront their emotions on a daily basis.
