# MedAssist User Guide/Manual

## General Information
<div style="text-align: justify">
MedAssist is a completely free mental health platform featuring a chatbot powered by a Retrevial-Augmented Generation (RAG) Large Language Model (LLM). Our platform offers users a simple and easy way to interact with a chatbot trained on only DSM-5 material for more accurate responses and impactful interactions. <br><br>

Users can reflect on past interactionsby creating journal entries, view summaries of past interactions, monitor their health report, and submit feedback. MedAssist is purely an informative source and users seeking real professional or medical assistance are urged to reach out to a trained psychiatrist or doctor. Users can view the resources page to get started or contact the national suicide-prevention hotline for emergencies.
