# Individual Capstone Assessment

## Introduction
For my senior design project, I want to take advantage of the growing potential of AI to create something that can genuinely support people in their daily lives. As a Computer Science student with a strong interest in both AI and medical field, I believe technology can play a meaningful role in addressing mental health challenges. My goal is to design a mental health support chatbot that offers accessible and empathetic conversations for students and other users. The chatbot will serve as a safe space where individuals can share their concerns and receive responses grounded in verified mental health resources rather than generic or unfiltered advice. With my background in machine learning and deep learning, I feel well prepared to tackle the technical challenges this project presents. More importantly, I view this work as a meaningful opportunity to apply my skills toward building technology that provides real, human centered support.

## College Curriculum
The coursework I have completed at the University of Cincinnati has provided me with a strong combination of theoretical and practical skills that directly support the development of this project. Courses such as Calculus (Multivariable Calculus) and Linear Algebra gave me the mathematical foundation to understand optimization, vector spaces, and transformations, which are central to how modern neural networks operate under the hood. Probability and Statistics and Intelligent Data Analysis courses further strengthened my ability to model uncertainty, analyze data, and evaluate system performance, all of which are critical when building an AI system that must respond reliably in varied contexts. On the applied side, Deep Learning exposed me to neural network architectures, including convolutional networks, transformers, and generative models, and gave me the hands-on experience training models on different types of datasets. Additionally, Cloud Computing taught me how to design and deploy distributed systems, which will be crucial for ensuring our chatbot can scale to support multiple users while remaining responsive and secure. These classes not only built my technical understanding of the algorithms powering LLM but also emphasized structured problem solving and collaboration through team projects. Together, they have prepared me to contribute effectively to both the AI design and deployment aspects of our mental health support chatbot.

## Co-op Experiences
My coop and research experiences have been equally important in preparing me for this project. As an Undergraduate Research Assistant at UC, I explored advanced AI methods such as transformers and generative models, which directly relate to the large language models our chatbot will rely on. This role gave me experience benchmarking multiple architectures, analyzing tradeoffs in scalability. In addition, at Riverain Technologies, I worked as a Research Intern developing medical imaging tools, including MATLAB GUIs to support automatic review, labeling, cleaning, and A/B testing of CT scans. These experience sharpened my ability to balance technical rigor with practical usability. Earlier, I also had experience creating React platform/websites, which strengthens my ability to build intuitive interfaces. Across these roles, I developed not only technical expertise in Python, Pytorch, MATLAB, and other frameworks/libraries but also non-technical skills such as teamwork, clear communication, and adapting solutions to real world needs

## Motivation
I am especially motivated to work on MedAssist because it represents the intersection of my academic interests and a meaningful social issue. Mental health is an important topic, particularly for students, and I believe MedAssist can play a role in making support more accessible. This project requires us to think carefully about empathy, safety, and trust, which makes the challenge both exciting and rewarding. I am inspired by the opportunity to use my skills in AI and software development to build something that could provide comfort and guidance to someone who needs it. I am also motivated by the collaborative nature of this capstone, since working with different people will allow me to learn new perspectives. Finally, the chance to combine technical innovation with human-centered impact is what excites me most about participating in this project.

## Preliminary Project Approach
Our preliminary approach to the project is to break the system into clear and modular stages. First, our team will collect and curate a set of verified mental health datasets and resources, making sure that the chatbot's responses are safe, accurate, and trustworthy. Next, we will design the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, integrating it with a LLM that can generate empathetic and context-aware responses. Once the core system is working, we will design a user friendly UI and deploy it so that it can support multiple users efficiently. We expect our accomplishments to include a functional prototype, complete technical documentation, and a demonstration that highlights both usability and safety. To evaluate contributions among the team, we will track progress against agreed milestones, test the codes, and seek feedback from teammates and our advisor. Completion will be determined when we deliver a chatbot that is technically sound, easy to use, and capable of making a small but meaningful difference in mental health accessibility.
