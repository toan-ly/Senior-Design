### <ins>Project Sought</ins>

My goal is to take on a project that will expand my skillset and challenge my capabilities. I'm especially interested in full-stack development with practical, real-world impact. With AI looking to transform the workplace, I'm also looking to gain experience utilizing or implementing AI in a way that could improve efficiency or help with data management.

My background is probably a little unconventional compared to many CS students, with a good chunk of my Co-Op experience centered around Information Technology. If required, I am open to exploring ideas branching into IT or cybersecurity if my skills may be more useful from those perspectives.
